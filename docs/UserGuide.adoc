== Introduction

Flashback helps students to use their time breaks to memorize things
like vocabulary and some general knowledges, especially those who prefer
command line interface (CLI) over clicks. Everything is organized into
flashcards, each contain one question. Users can also tag the flashcards
to group them and see their progress over time through statistics.

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `flashback.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
