== Introduction

FlashMind helps students to use their time breaks to memorize things
like vocabulary and some general knowledges, especially those who prefer
command line interface (CLI) over clicks. Everything is organized into
flashcards, each contain one question. Users can also tag the flashcards
to group them and see their progress over time through statistics.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `flashback.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your flashback.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all flashcards
* *`add q/How long is Mount Blanc Tunnel? a/11611m d/An amazing tunnel on the boarder of France and Italy`*: Add a flashcard about Mount Blanc Tunnel
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the flashcard with index 3 on the listed flashcards.

=== Adding new flashcards

Add a new flashcard and specify its question, definition, tags, choices and answer. +
Format: `add q/QUESTION d/DEFINITION [t/TAG]... [c/CHOICE]... a/ANSWER`

****
* QUESTION, DEFINITION and ANSWER must be provided while creating a flashcard, tags and choices are optional.
* If there are no choices specified in the flashcard, the system will generate a short answer flashcard. Otherwise,
  the system will generate an MCQ flashcard.
* Note that during the quiz mode, to answer a short answer flashcard correctly, you must input an answer exactly match
  answer you typed while this flashcard is created. Thus, be sure to provide enough information in QUESTION and DEFINITION
  for you to figure out the exact correct answer.
* Note that while creating an MCQ flashcard, the answer is the input for your correct choice, not just a number.
  If the answer you input does not match any of the choices, the system will tell you this flashcard is invalid.
  Please refer to the following examples for a better understanding.
****

Examples:

* `add q/What is the tallest mountain in the world? d/This mountain is on the boarder of China and Nepal. a/Mount Everest` :
  Creates a new short answer flashcard with the given question, definition and answer.
* `add q/What is the tallest mountain in thw world? d/This mountain is on the boarder of China and Nepal. c/Mountain Everest
  c/Mount Blanc c/Shkhara c/Bukit Timah a/Mountain Everest` : Creates a new MCQ flashcard with the given question, definition choices and answer.
* `add q/What is the tallest mountain in thw world? d/This mountain is on the boarder of China and Nepal. c/Mountain Everest
  c/Mount Blanc c/Shkhara c/Bukit Timah a/Alps` : Since the answer you input does not match with any of the choices, the
  system will generate an error message.

  flashcard number 2, then you typed `edit 2 c/Mount Blanc`, then there will be only one choice left for flashcard number 2,
  which is Mount Blanc. The same applies when editing tags.
* While editing the answer for an MCQ flashcard, still ensure that the updated answer matches any one of the choices.
