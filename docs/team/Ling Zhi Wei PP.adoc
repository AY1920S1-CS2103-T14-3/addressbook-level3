** What it does: Allows the user to generate statistics about cards by tag or overall. Displays information in a helpful graphical information as well as in text
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user might want to track the progress of his learning experience.
** Highlights: This enhancement required some architecture changes to allow statistics information to communicated to the UI . It required an in-depth analysis of  UI design alternatives. The implementation was challenging due to communication between the GUI to detailed information and creating a separate window with graphics.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add choices to flashcard*
** What it does: Allows the user to add a list of choices to the flashcard.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user can now create multiple choice flashcards which greatly improves versatility and .
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Major enhancement*: added *a timer to the quiz mode*
** What it does: Allows the user to have timed quizzes.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user can simulate test environments with the quiz system adding a new layer of functionality .
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of UI design. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_


* *Minor enhancement*:
** Major changes to UI to fix the majority of the bugs and improved usability.
